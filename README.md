## Swahili Data(News) Aggregator


Cron is a tool that allows you to execute _something_ on a schedule. This is
typically done using the cron syntax. We allow you to execute a function
whenever your scheduled job triggers. We also allow you to execute a job
external to the javascript process using `child_process`. Additionally, this
library goes beyond the basic cron syntax and allows you to
supply a Date object. This will be used as the trigger for your callback. Cron
syntax is still an acceptable CronTime format. Although the Cron patterns
supported here extend on the standard Unix format to support seconds digits,
leaving it off will default to 0 and match the Unix behavior.
